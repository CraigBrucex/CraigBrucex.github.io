<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
