<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Increase warehouse and plant space by eliminating the need for stocking parts and providing space to service equipment. Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability. Here at 4 Wheel Parts, we have a huge selection of shock absorbers from the leading brands in the industry such as Pro Comp Suspension, King Shocks and Skyjacker to choose the shock absorber for your off-road vehicle or your daily driver.</p>

When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance.
