<h3>Hand Pallet Truck  Brick NJ 08724</h3>
<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast. With maximum lift capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, JCB's 930 and 940 rough-terrain, straight-mast forklift models are purpose-built with a one-piece frame.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
