<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
