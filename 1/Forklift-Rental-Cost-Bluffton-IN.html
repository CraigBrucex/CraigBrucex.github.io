<p>The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. These are Class 5 forklifts.

<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary. The point of these vehicles seems mostly to project an obnoxiously aggressive attitude over all other drivers. If you're passionate about off-roading , then lifting your truck is a great choice.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months.

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
