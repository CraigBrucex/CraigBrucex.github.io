<h3>New, Used, Or Rental Forklifts Northborough MA 01532</h3>
<p>Although Hangcha's 35 series of rough-terrain forklifts hasn't moved to electric yet, Wang says Hangcha has developed the A160 16 T electric forklift to meet market demand. It turns out that lifted trucks do more than just look cool â€” this modification brings some key benefits. Now, it is not a guaranteed lock that your driving experience will immensely improve after investing in a lifted truck.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
