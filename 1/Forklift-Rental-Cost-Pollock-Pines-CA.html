Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts. Order Pickers : Use: Order picker trucks place the operator on an elevating platform along with the forks. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
