Though moving away from the traditional LPG and diesel powered forklift is a major decision, electrics are associated with many advantages.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full reaward tilt, whichever is less stable.
