We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forkliftâ€”except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load.

In addition, reach trucks offer versatile benefits in various tasks for industries such as manufacturing industries, shop floors, transportation hubs, warehouses, logistics, and factories, owing to their compact design as well as greater maneuverability capability.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck Rental Coral Springs</h2>

<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body.
