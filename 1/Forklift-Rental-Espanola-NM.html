<p>Understand the causes of instability of the truck and loads. We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
