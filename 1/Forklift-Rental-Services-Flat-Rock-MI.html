The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>

The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
