For many people, the I'm on top of the world” feeling that comes with driving a lifted truck is enough to warrant buying one.</p>
<p>With the test load elevated to maximum height, and for trucks with tilting up 4 rights without change in the original overhang dimensions, the test platform shall be tipped to the specified slope.
