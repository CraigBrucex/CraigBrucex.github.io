<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>
<p>Where as a Telescoping Boom Lift is best suited to outdoor construction applications where reach is required to place loads on top of structures under construction. Also considered as one of the very good pallet trucks, this is a very powerful pallet jack. In this research scope, Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV and Class V types of forklift trucks are analyzed and revenue is estimated.</p>

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck.
