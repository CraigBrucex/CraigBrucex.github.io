Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.

Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
