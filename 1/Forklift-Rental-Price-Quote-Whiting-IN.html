We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class I powered industrial trucks. That's because standing forklifts allow the operator to help move stock on and off the lift, and move around easily to navigate the tops of racks and mezzanines.
