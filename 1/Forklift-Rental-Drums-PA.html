If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
