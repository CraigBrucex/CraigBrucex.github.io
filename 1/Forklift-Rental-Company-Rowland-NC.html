Therefore, leading manufacturers of reach trucks in the market are developing compact and affordable reach trucks to cater to a large customer base. Our valued rough terrain forklift dealers have the training to provide effective support to over 10,000 units in service worldwide. OSHA has defined seven forklift classes in order for forklift operators to be fully certified and prepared to operate the distinct vehicles.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>In fact, OSHA's Powered Industrial Trucks eTool resource reviews some interesting max load capacities for common forklifts.
