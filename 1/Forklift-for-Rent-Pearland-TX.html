<p>DaSilva says Stackers comparable to forklifts cost a little over $6,000, or half the price. We provide heavy-duty forklifts for moving your cargo. A rough terrain forklift is set up to deal with a number of weights and loads, but the operator is the key source who focuses on keeping everyone safe and the machine safe. Purchasing a new rough terrain lift truck can cost up to $100,000.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
