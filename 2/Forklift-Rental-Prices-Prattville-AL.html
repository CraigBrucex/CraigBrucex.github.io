<h2>How A Crown Pallet Jack Can Benefit Your Business Prattville </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects.

With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
