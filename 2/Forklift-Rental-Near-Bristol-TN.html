<p>Pickup trucks offer different levels of functionality and performance for different drivers - that flexibility and power is what a lot of people love about trucks. We are a well-known manufacturer, exporter, wholesaler, distributor and supplier of Full Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient performing product of our company. A significant portion of my business deals with forklift operator training (or more precisely, powered industrial truck operator training).</p>
<p>20. 20 Final Rule  OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998.

For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>
