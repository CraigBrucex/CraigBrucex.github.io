<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts.

<p>Driving a couple of inches higher will not only offer you a much better view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris. Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>

Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late.
