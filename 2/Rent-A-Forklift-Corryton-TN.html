<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>
