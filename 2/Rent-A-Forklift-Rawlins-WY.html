<p>This function is limited to some (Class 2 & 3) Reach Trucks”. Choosing the right lift kit height is critical to maintaining the comfort, ride quality, and utility of your truck. Despite this type of design, counterbalance forklifts aren't immune to accidents. Hand Pallet Truck with Weigh Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in a busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want.</p>
<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy.

<p>Furthermore, the range also includes galvanised and stainless steel pallet jacks, ideal for use in the food and pharmaceutical industry where hygiene is central. Category includes box trucks, maintenance trucks, forklifts, tow trucks, flatbed trucks, electric carts. Wire guiding or rail guiding order pickers means that the lift truck can operate in an aisle as narrow as 54 inches.</p>
