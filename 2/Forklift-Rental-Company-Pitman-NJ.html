<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool. A suspension lift is a more popular option and gives you more ground clearance than a body lift - it's the only way to get enough height for larger tires.</p>

Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>Gas-powered forklifts offer long service lives with relatively low maintenance costs. Efficient storage is an operational focus for many warehouse and industrial space owners and forklift trucks allow a company to make the most of their vertical storage capacity. A few strokes of the handle provide 110mm of lift, the PMHE-101 heavy-duty pump is built to take thousands of pick-up and deposit cycles.</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>
