<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

With so many forklift types to choose from it can be difficult to find the forklift perfect for your environment. This financing option also gives customers a chance to return the equipment at the end of the rental period. They can function as an off-road forklift for smaller loads, saving the operator the expense of a completely separate machine.</p>
<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk. Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
<p>All hydraulic functions can be controlled using proportional finger tips for precise and safe load handling.

From warehousing to building materials, beverage to rubber products, NW Lift Truck Service has the forklift answer.</p>
