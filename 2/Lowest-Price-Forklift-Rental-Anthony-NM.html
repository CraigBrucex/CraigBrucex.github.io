<h2>Hand Pallet Anthony</h2>
<p>The unit of competence is known as the National High Risk Licence Unit of Competence TLILIC2001 - Licence to Operate a Forklift Truck, or in the case of an LO licence Unit of Competence TLILIC2002 - Licence to Operate an Order Picking Forklift Truck.

<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, of a load with a stated horizontal and vertical distance to the center of gravity of the load that a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable also on 406 of this Standard, can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.
