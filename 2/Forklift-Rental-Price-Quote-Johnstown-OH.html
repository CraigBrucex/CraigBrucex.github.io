<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas. Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height.

Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again.
