<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions. One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>If you're ready to experience what a lifted truck can do for you, stop by and see the team at Nations Trucks today. Rentals are also useful to those who experience increased workload on a seasonal basis. Forklifts have come a long way since 1906, when an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, Pa., added storage battery power to a baggage wagon, producing what was probably the first powered platform truck.</p>

The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>While maintaining a small turning radius, the P Series machines are built to a 22,000-pound capacity, and even larger as specifically required. Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>First, we assembled 105 different kinds of forklifts from all walks of industrial life. Forklifts are also organized based on their classification. We highly recommend that you consult with us on which unit is best suited to your needs and that you discuss the best forklift rentals with our team to ensure that you streamline material handling processes within your business and keep related costs low at the same time.</p>
