From a pallet jack to a telehandler, Lencrow Forklifts has Australia's largest and most comprehensive range of new, used and hire equipment. The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Whether your company is in the market for a new forklift, or if a pre-owned forklift is more appropriate, Granite Industrial can guide you through the buying process. For everything from bottle jacks (for 2-100 tons) and floor jacks (for 2-35 tons) to transmission jacks (with heavy-duty, high-rise, and telescopic options) and more, you can find the hydraulic jacks you need to get the job done right - and safely.</p>
