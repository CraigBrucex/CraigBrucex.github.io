Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>

If you require an order picking forklift that can utilised for high racking situations, we have a range that can complete these tasks with ease. Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
